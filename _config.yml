            Through FAU's [NSF IUCRC](http://mlab.fau.edu/cake/) project, worked with the Credit Risk and Management Department and the Centre of Excellence in Machine Learning at [World Omni Financial Corp.](https://www.worldomni.com/) (Deerfield Beach, FL). Worked on multiple projects aimed to improve the efficiency of business operations in the company.
            
            - Developed a process automation project which calculates daily delinquencies and dynamic estimates of daily and month-end delinquencies and aggregates them in permanent datasets, along with error handling using default scenarios.
            - Afforded the company to build automated Delinquency Dashboards using the permanent datasets to be shared with the management on daily basis.
            - Built and analyzed multiple models (Monte Carlo Simulation, Pattern Recognition and Time Series) which based on historical call logs and performance of all accounts, estimates the optimum number of agents for staffing a call-center.
            - Analyzed, processed and migrated complex datasets using advanced querying and visualization tools.

            - Implemented a cloud-based back-end setup (NoSQL DB and REST API) to store and share (in compatible formats) temperature data from a Bluetooth-enabled thermometer via a healthcare mobile app. See Article: https://bit.ly/2GLRlzw
            - Built a framework of integrated open-source tools (NoSQL DB and REST API) to support the development of healthcare apps (on top of VistA EHR), thus providing interoperability, data analytics, and mobile access. Demo: https://bit.ly/2qjpwEw
